# Java-Concurrency-Practice
WordCount.java is implemented by Java Concurrency programming

This is the parallel version of WordCount.java. I used a concurrent hashmap to allow parallel accesses.

updateCount() function used to maintain the count correctly.

main() function used to block files into chunks
